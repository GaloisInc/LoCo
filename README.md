# LoCo

LoCo, originally short for Location Constraints, now represents a collection of
tooling for designing and reasoning about parsing, formats, and computation in
general.

The most modern tooling here is:
- [`optimal`](./optimal): tooling for on-demand, cached DAGs of computation
- [`pear`](./pear): tooling for defining parsers based on document "regions"

Older work can be found in:
- [`locc`](./locc): early efforts towards static format/parser reasoning
