# `optimal-pear`

This package is an example of instantiating `optimal` with [`pear`](./pear) -
that is, using `pear`'s region-based parsers and utilities as the "language" of
`optimal` bindings. Furthermore, this is an example of using a non-trivial monad
for `optimal`'s computations - `pear`'s `PT m` monad.
